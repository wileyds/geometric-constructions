    "\n",
    "The Brillouin zones are determined by applying the Wigner-Seitz construction to the reciprocal lattice. Zone interiors are defined by the number of times a Bragg plane is crossed when traveling in a straight line from the origin. At present, only the first Brillouin zone is calculated, which simplfies matters because it consists of a single polyhedron. The polyhedron is defined in terms of its faces, each corresponding to a single Bragg plane or $\\mathbf{K}$-point in the reciprocal lattice. The faces are in turn defined as a set of edges, each of which is defined as a set of two vectors denoting its start and end points. The 1st Brillouin zone is defined in an iterative manner: first, all Bragg planes (in a reasonably large volume of k-space) are ranked according to their distance from the origin; an initial cell is constructed using the set of such planes nearest to the origin; then the next nearest set of planes is used to truncate the cell, and this process is repeated for each successively more distant set of Bragg planes until it is no longer possible to do so. Whether to continue or not can be determined using the \"vertex test:\" if the distance to the farthest-out vertex of the polyhedron exceeds the distance to the family of Bragg planes in question, the planes may (though not necessarily will) intersect and therefore truncate the polyhedron.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is explained in more detail, with reference to relevant sections of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Initialize Parameters\n",
    "Define key constants for the construction - how many $\\mathbf{K}$-points in the reciprocal lattice to include (i.e., what range of $\\mathbf{k}$-space are we allowing in the calculations), how many zones to calculate, what the threshold for roundoff error should be when locating intersections of lines & planes. Also choose a real space lattice to define the crystal structure (simple cubic, fcc, bcc, hcp, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Generate the Reciprocal Lattice and Bragg Planes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Reciprocal Lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "The reciprocal lattice is the set of all points in $\\mathbf{k}$-space that are integer combinations of the reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b_1, b_2, b_3}$: $\\{\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{K}^3: \\mathbf{K} = n_1\\mathbf{b_1} + n_2\\mathbf{b_2} +n_3\\mathbf{b_3}, n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The reciprocal lattice vectors are calculated from the real-space lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a_1, a_2, a_3}$ using the definition $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = \\delta_{ij}$ (for simplicity, we do not employ the solid-state physics convention of including the factor $2\\pi$). Hence,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\mathbf{b_1 = \\frac{a_2 \\times a_3}{a_1 \\cdot (a_2 \\times a_3)}};\n",
    "\\qquad \\mathbf{b_2 = \\frac{a_3 \\times a_1}{a_1 \\cdot (a_2 \\times a_3)}} ;\n",
    "\\qquad \\mathbf{b_3 = \\frac{a_1 \\times a_2}{a_1 \\cdot (a_2 \\times a_3)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a restricted set of values of the integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$, we can generate a large enough subset of the full reciprocal lattice to determine the desired zones. This may not be known a priori, so it is probably safest to set the $n_\\mathrm{max}$ parameter to be significantly larger than the desired number of zones to be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Bragg Planes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bragg planes are defined as the planes bisecting the vector $\\mathbf{K}$ from the origin to specific point in the reciprocal lattice. The general description of the Bragg plane $\\mathscr{P}_\\mathbf{K}$ corresponding to lattice point $\\mathbf{K}$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\mathscr{P}_\\mathbf{K} = \\left\\{ \\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{K}^3: \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K} + t\\mathbf{v}, t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\mathbf{v} \\in \\{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{K}^3: \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{K} = 0 \\} \\right\\}$;\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, points in the plane are defined by the \"normal\" vector $\\mathbf{K_\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K}$ and an arbitrary vector $t\\mathbf{v}$ that lies within the plane. Note that it is more convenient to work with the vectors $\\mathbf{K}$ or $\\mathbf{K_\\frac{1}{2}}$ than the strict normal to the plane $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}_\\mathscr{P_\\mathbf{K}}} = \\mathbf{\\frac{K}{||K||}}$. The magnitude $||\\mathbf{K_\\frac{1}{2}}|| = \\frac{1}{2}K$ represents the distance of closest approach of $\\mathscr{P}_\\mathbf{K}$ to the origin. The planes may then be conveniently ranked by the magnitude of their corresponding $\\mathbf{K}$-points, and the results collected in a Pandas dataframe for easy reference."
