    "The Brillouin zones are determined by applying the Wigner-Seitz construction to the reciprocal lattice. Zone interiors are defined by the number of times a Bragg plane is crossed when traveling in a straight line from the origin. At present, only the first Brillouin zone is calculated, which simplfies matters because it consists of a single polyhedron. The polyhedron is defined in terms of its faces, each corresponding to a single Bragg plane or $\\mathbf{K}$-point in the reciprocal lattice.* The faces are in turn defined as a set of edges, each of which is defined as a set of two vectors denoting its start and end points. The 1st Brillouin zone is defined in an iterative manner: first, all Bragg planes (in a reasonably large volume of k-space) are ranked according to their distance from the origin; an initial cell is constructed using the set of such planes nearest to the origin; then the next nearest set of planes is used to truncate the cell, and this process is repeated for each successively more distant set of Bragg planes until it is no longer possible to do so. Whether to continue or not can be determined using the \"vertex test:\" if the distance to the farthest-out vertex of the polyhedron exceeds the distance to the family of Bragg planes in question, the planes may (though not necessarily will) intersect and therefore truncate the polyhedron.\n",

    "\\*A note on terminology: at various points, the terms \"$\\mathbf{K}$-plane,\" \"$\\mathbf{K}$-line,\" \"$\\mathbf{K}$-point,\" and \"Bragg plane\" may be used interchangeably to describe features of the same geometric construction. Specifically, \"$\\mathbf{K}$-plane\" and \"Bragg plane\" are strictly equivalent - i.e., the plane that bisects the line segment in K-space $\\mathbb{K}^3$ between the origin and the reciprocal lattice point $\\mathbf{K}$ (i.e., the corresponding \"$\\mathbf{K}$-point\"). The \"$\\mathbf{K}$-line\" is the line containing this line segment. In many cases, the point $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{K}_\\frac{1}{2}$, the point at which the $\\mathbf{K}$-line strikes the Bragg plane, is more useful than the corresponding $\\mathbf{K}$-point, and deserves its own notation.\n",

The reciprocal lattice vectors are calculated from the real-space lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a_1, a_2, a_3}$ using the definition $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = \\delta_{ij}$ (for simplicity, we do not employ the solid-state physics convention of including the factor $2\\pi$).

    "The first zone is special because it has no interior bounding surface(s), so we calculate it separately. The overall procedure will be to iterate through families of Bragg planes of increasing distance from the origin and use them to define a polyhedron enclosed by them and the previous cell. In other words, the first construction will create a trial cell, and successive iterations will create new cells by chopping off the corners of the previous one, until the next family of planes is too distant to do so.\n",

    "### 2A.1. Determine Trial Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The first cell will be defined as the polyhedron whose faces are defined by the intersections of each Bragg plane with its nearest neighbors. Identification of the nearest neighbors is not trivial, and investigating the intersections of a given plane with all others in the same family do not sufficiently constrain the space, although this is a useful starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing so, it is useful to formally define what we mean by a polyhedron. For the present purposes, it suffices to describe a polyhedron as the surface $\\mathscr{S}$ of all $\\mathbf{k}$-points belonging to a set of $N_\\mathrm{F}$ polygonal faces ${\\mathscr{F}_i}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathscr{N.B.}$ This definition obliges us to adopt a recursive scheme wherein each component of the polyhedron is defined by the bounding geometries of lower dimension - i.e., the 3D volume of the polyhedron is defined in terms of its bounding faces, each 2D face is defined by its bounding edges, and each 1D edge is a line segment defined by a pair of (0D) vertices. While it would be convenient to define the polyhedron solely as a list of its vertices, doing so is not practical because vital topological information is lost. This information is, however, preserved when the edges are listed, so it is best to adopt the hierarchical definition scheme described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the above scheme, each polygonal face $\\mathscr{F}_i$ is defined by (though not rigorously equivalent to) the set of its $N_\\mathrm{E}$ bounding edges $\\{\\mathscr{E}_{ij},j=1,2,...,N_\\mathrm{E}\\}$. Each edge is in turn defined by (though again, not rigorously equivalent to) the pair of points $(\\mathbf{p}_{ij1},\\mathbf{p}_{ij2})$ bounding the line segment. This scheme can be implemented in the code by defining the cell as a list of \"face\" objects. Each face is most conveniently represented as a dictionary with two key-value pairs: the \"Edges\" key corresponds to a list of pairs of vectors defining the edge endpoints; and the \"K\" key corresponds to the $\\mathbf{K}$-point generating the Bragg plane in which the face lies. This information is not strictly necessary (the $\\mathbf{K}$-point could be inferred from the edges), but it simplifies the job of keeping track of the faces.\n",

    "#### 2A.1.1. Construct Individual Faces in the Trial Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin constructing the trial cell by looping over all $\\mathbf{K}$-points defining the individual Bragg plane, and building the corresponding face by identifying the smallest area enclosed by all possible edges formed by the intersections of each other Bragg plane in the family.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To find the edges, we start by defining the lines of which the edges are a part, from the plane intersections. While scanning over all other planes, we can immediately reject any that are parallel, using the condition $\\mathbf{K}_1 \\times \\mathbf{K}_2 = 0$, where $\\mathbf{K}_1$ refers to the face-defining $\\mathbf{K}$-point and $\\mathbf{K}_2$ to the (possibly) edge-defining candidate plane; both are normal to their respective Bragg planes (but not of unit length). \n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2A.1.1.1.1. Define Bounding Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The general expression for any line is $\\mathbf{p} + t\\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is any point on the line, $\\mathbf{v}$ is any vector parallel to the line, and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a parameter quantifying the distance along it. It is convenient to take $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{K}_1 \\times \\mathbf{K}_2$, and to define $\\mathbf{p}$ as the point of closest approach of the line to the origin, such that $\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$. The components of $\\mathbf{p}$ are further constrained by the requirement that it lie on both Bragg planes. Taking the first plane as an example, we can express $\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K}_1 + \\mathbf{u}$ for an arbitrary vector $\\mathbf{u}$ parallel to the plane (i.e., $\\mathbf{u \\cdot K_1} = 0$). Taking the dot product of both sides of the equation with $\\mathbf{K}_1$ yields the relation $\\mathbf{p \\cdot K_1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{K}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{K}_1 = \\frac{1}{2} K_1^2$. An equivalent expression is obtained for the other plane, so the components of p are completely specified by the projections of $\\mathbf{p}$ onto $\\mathbf{K}_1$, $\\mathbf{K}_2$, and $\\mathbf{v}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\left\\{ \\begin{array}  \\mathbf{\\mathbf{p}} \\cdot \\mathbf{K}_1 =\\frac{1}{2} K_1^2 \\\\ \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{K}_2 =\\frac{1}{2} K_2^2 \\\\ \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. $\n",
    "\n",
    "This system of equations can be solved by forming the matrix $\\mathsf{K}$ whose rows are $\\mathbf{K}_1$, $\\mathbf{K}_2$, and $\\mathbf{v}$. Then, $\\mathbf{p}$ is defined by the equation $\\mathsf{K}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{b} = (\\frac{1}{2}K_1^2, \\frac{1}{2}K_2^2, 0)^T$. Non-trivial solutions $\\mathbf{p} = \\mathsf{K}^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$ exist if $\\mathrm{det}\\ \\mathsf{K} \\neq 0$, which is guaranteed by the nonvanishing cross product defining $\\mathbf{v}$ in the parallel-plane filtering condition enforced above. Thus, we can define the bounding lines generated by each other Bragg plane by the pair of (vector-valued) parameters $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, and track them in a list.\n",

    "###### 2A.1.1.1.2. Rank Bounding Lines by Distance from the Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the bounding lines are defined, they may be ranked by their distance of closest approach to the \"center\" of the Bragg plane - i.e., the point $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{K}$ at which the vector $\\mathbf{K}$ strikes it. An advantage of the above bounding line parameterization is that the point $\\mathbf{p}$ is automatically the point on the bounding line closest to $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{K}$, as well as the origin. (To prove this, minimize the magnitude of the general displacement vector $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K} - (\\mathbf{p} + t\\mathbf{v})$ to a point on the bounding line, which occurs at $t=0$.) Thus, the bounding lines may be conveniently partitioned into subsets according to the magnitudes $||\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{K} - \\mathbf{p}||$ and ranked accordingly.\n",

    "###### 2A.1.1.1.3. Construct Edges from Bounding Line Intersections\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the bounding lines are now ranked, we still do not know which of the subsets are necessary to define the face, and which are superfluous. To make this discrimination, we deploy a process analogous to the face truncation, to wit: start with the nearest set of bounding lines to the $\\mathbf{K}$-line and calculate the line segments corresponding to the edges, bounded by the intersections of those lines; then successively iterate through each successively more distant set of bounding lines, and apply the vertex test to determine whether it is possible to truncate the face further; if so, proceed; if not, then the face is complete. \n",

The intersections with all other (non-parallel) bounding lines define a set of candidate vertices for the edge, of which only the two that are closest to the $\\mathbf{K}$-line should be retained.\n",

Note, however, that this condition is not strong enough to guarantee intersection of the two lines, since they may have different \"velocity\" vectors but lie in parallel planes - i.e., be skew lines. The intersection criterion $\\mathbf{p}_1 + t_1\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{p}_2 + t_2\\mathbf{v}_2$ is an overdetermined system of 3 equations in the two unknowns $(t_1, t_2)$, which may or may not have a solution.
